      "question": "Which Python library is most commonly used for creating static plots?",
      "options": [
        "Seaborn",
        "Plotly",
        "Matplotlib",
        "Bokeh"
      ],

      "question": "What type of chart is best for showing the relationship between two continuous variables?",
      "options": [
        "Bar chart",
        "Pie chart",
        "Scatter plot",
        "Histogram"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Scatter plots are ideal for showing the relationship between two continuous variables, as they display individual data points and reveal correlations, clusters, and outliers."

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a good practice in data visualization?",
      "options": [
        "Using appropriate color schemes",
        "Including clear labels and titles",
        "Using 3D effects for 2D data",
        "Choosing the right chart type for your data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Using 3D effects for 2D data is generally not recommended as it can distort the data representation and make it harder to accurately interpret the information."

      "id": 5,
      "question": "What does the 'hue' parameter in Seaborn plots control?",
      "options": [
        "The size of the plot",
        "The color of the plot elements",
        "The transparency of the plot",
        "The third dimension of the data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'hue' parameter in Seaborn controls the color of plot elements, allowing you to encode additional categorical information through color differentiation."

        "Bar chart",
        "Histogram",
        "Scatter plot"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Histograms are specifically designed to show the distribution of a single continuous variable by dividing the data into bins and showing the frequency of values in each bin."

    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What is the main advantage of using Seaborn over Matplotlib?",
      "options": [
        "It's faster",
        "It provides more statistical visualizations and better default aesthetics",
        "It uses less memory",
        "It's easier to install"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Seaborn's main advantage is that it provides more statistical visualizations and better default aesthetics, making it easier to create publication-ready plots with minimal code."

        "Line chart",
        "Scatter plot"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Line charts are ideal for showing trends over time as they connect data points chronologically, making it easy to see patterns, changes, and trends in the data."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "What does a box plot show?",
      "options": [
        "The mean and standard deviation",
        "The distribution of data including quartiles, median, and outliers",
        "The correlation between variables",
        "The frequency of categorical data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A box plot shows the distribution of data including quartiles, median, and outliers, providing a compact way to visualize the spread and skewness of the data."

    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Which of the following is an example of a categorical variable?",
      "options": [
        "Height in centimeters",
        "Temperature in degrees",
        "Product category",
        "Sales revenue"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Product category is a categorical variable as it represents distinct groups or categories (like 'Electronics', 'Clothing', 'Books') rather than numerical values."
