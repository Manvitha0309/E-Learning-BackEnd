      "question": "What is the main difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
      "options": [
        "Supervised learning is faster than unsupervised learning",
        "Supervised learning uses labeled data, unsupervised learning doesn't",
        "Unsupervised learning is more accurate than supervised learning",
        "Supervised learning only works with numerical data"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The main difference is that supervised learning uses labeled training data (input-output pairs), while unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns."

    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which algorithm is commonly used for linear regression?",
      "options": [
        "K-means clustering",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Gradient descent is commonly used to optimize the parameters in linear regression by minimizing the cost function through iterative updates."

    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What is overfitting in machine learning?",
      "options": [
        "When a model performs poorly on training data",
        "When a model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize",
        "When a model takes too long to train",
        "When a model uses too many features"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, and fails to generalize to new, unseen data."

    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which metric is used to evaluate classification models?",
      "options": [
        "Mean squared error",

      "id": 5,
      "question": "What is the purpose of cross-validation?",
      "options": [
        "To speed up model training",
        "To reduce the size of the dataset",
        "To assess model performance and prevent overfitting",
        "To select the best features"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Cross-validation is used to assess model performance and prevent overfitting by training and testing the model on different subsets of the data."

        "DBSCAN",
        "K-means clustering",
        "Mean shift clustering"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "K-means clustering requires you to specify the number of clusters (k) beforehand, unlike other algorithms that can determine the optimal number automatically."

    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What is feature scaling and why is it important?",
      "options": [
        "Making features have the same scale to prevent some features from dominating",
        "Removing unnecessary features from the dataset",
        "Adding new features to improve model performance",
        "Converting categorical features to numerical ones"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Feature scaling ensures all features have the same scale, preventing features with larger ranges from dominating the model and improving algorithm performance."

      "options": [
        "Email spam detection",
        "House price prediction",
        "Customer segmentation",
        "Image recognition"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Customer segmentation is an example of unsupervised learning, where we group customers based on their behavior without knowing the 'correct' segments beforehand."

    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "What does the term 'bias' refer to in machine learning?",
      "options": [
        "Prejudice in the training data",
        "The error introduced by approximating a real-world problem",
        "The difference between predicted and actual values",
        "The complexity of the model"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model, leading to systematic errors in predictions."
