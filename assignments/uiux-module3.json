      "id": 5,
      "question": "What is the purpose of prototyping in Figma?",
      "options": [
        "To create the final code",
        "To create interactive mockups that simulate user interactions",
        "To export designs to other tools",
        "To organize design files"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Prototyping in Figma creates interactive mockups that simulate user interactions, allowing designers and stakeholders to test and validate design concepts before development."

      "id": 6,
      "question": "What is auto-layout in Figma?",
      "options": [
        "A feature that automatically arranges elements in a frame",
        "A type of component",
        "A color adjustment tool",
        "A text formatting feature"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Auto-layout in Figma automatically arranges elements in a frame, making it easier to create responsive designs and maintain consistent spacing between elements."

    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What is the difference between a frame and a group in Figma?",
      "options": [
        "There is no difference",
        "Frames have layout properties, groups don't",
        "Groups are for text, frames are for shapes",
        "Frames are temporary, groups are permanent"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Frames have layout properties like auto-layout and can be used for responsive design, while groups are simply containers that hold elements together without layout properties."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "What is the purpose of constraints in Figma?",
      "options": [
        "To limit the number of elements in a design",
        "To control how elements resize and position within a frame",
        "To restrict access to design files",
        "To set design deadlines"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Constraints in Figma control how elements resize and position within a frame, ensuring elements maintain their relative positions when the frame is resized."
